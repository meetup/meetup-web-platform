# Queries

Queries are the core data request interface for any Meetup Web Platform app.
They are primarily generated by application Routes to indicate what data each
one needs from the API when it is active. However, they can be used for any
request to the API, and are therefore used for POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests
as well.

At a high level, you can think of a Query as a JSON-encoded API request, including
all request parameters, the endpoint URI, and any metadata properties like
custom headers

## Spec

### Query object

A Query is just a plain object with the following shape:

```js
{
  ref: string,
  endpoint: string,
  params?: object,
  type?: string,
  meta?: {
    flags?: string[],
    method?: string
  },
}
```

#### `ref`

A unique string reference to the query. The `ref` is used to uniquely identify
the query _and_ uniquely assign the resulting API data to Redux state at
`state.api[ref]`.

#### `endpoint`

The Meetup API endpoint as a URL pathname, e.g. `/members/123456`. Note that
this URL should not include any parameter placeholders like `/:urlname` - the
values should be filled in as needed.

#### `params`

The parameters that should be passed to the API either in the querystring (for
GET requests) or the request body (for POST requests).

#### `type`

A one-word description of the 'data type' expected to be returned by the API
for this query. This information is used on the server to further process the
data for certain data types like `'group'` objects, which will receive special
duotone photo URLs in addition to the standard photo URLs provided by the API.

The `type` should be the same regardless of whether the returned data is an
array or a singleton.

**Type examples**

- `group`
- `member`
- `event`
- `comment`
- feature-specific objects like `home`, `conversations`

#### `flags`

An array of feature flag (Runtime Flag) names that should be returned
alongside the main request.

#### `meta`

##### `method`

You can force the query to be sent with a particular HTTP method by specifying
it here as a string: `get`, `post`, `delete`, or `patch`. Note that
you should never try to make a request that contains multiple queries with
different `method`s.

Alternatively, you can use method-specific action creators to automatically
assingn the method and make the request for individual requests.

### Query Response

A query response is also a plain object

```js
{
  ref: string,
  value: any,
  type?: string,
  flags?: array,
  meta?: object,
}
```

## Usage

In general, queries start as properties of API-request-related actions, yielding
responses that are applied to Redux state.

### Action creation

You should generally use the action creators in `apiActionCreators` to create
actions for queries

#### `get`

```js
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

const getQuery = {
  endpoint: 'ny-tech/members',
  ref: 'newMember',
};
const getAction = api.get(getQuery);
```

#### `post`

```js
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

const postQuery = {
  endpoint: 'ny-tech/members',
  ref: 'newMember',
  params: { name, bio },
};
const postAction = api.post(postQuery);
```

#### `delete`

```js
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

const deleteQuery = {
  endpoint: 'ny-tech/members/123456',
  ref: 'deletedMember',
  params: { id },
};
const deleteAction = api.delete(deleteQuery);
```

### Query dispatch

Use Redux's `store.dispatch` or `bindActionCreators` to dispatch the query
actions.

### Sync middleware

When query actions are dispatched, the sync middleware will generate a
corresponding `fetch` to the API proxy endpoint of the app server, e.g.

```
GET /mu_api?queries=[query, ...]
```

**API response array returned as JSON from app server**

The app server API proxy endpoint will respond with an array of Query responses.

```js
[
  {
    ref: string,
    value: {},
    error?: {},
    type?: string,
    meta?: {},  // data returned from API separate from `value`
  },
  // ...
]
```

The fetchQueries function will then filter these Query Response objects into
separate `successes` and `errors` arrays, where each array element is an object
containing the original `query` object and its corresponding `response`:

```js
{
  successes: [{ query, response }, ...],
  errors: [{ query, response }, ...],
}
```

The sync middleware will read these two arrays and generate a separate
`API_RESP_SUCCESS` or `API_RESP_ERROR` action for each response object.

The platform reducer will then read the values into `state.api[ref]` for each
response.

**Redux state after being processed by `API_RESP_SUCCESS` action**

```js
{
  [ref]: {
    type,
    value: {},
    meta?: {}
  },
  // ...
}
```

**Redux state after being processed by `API_RESP_ERROR` action**

```js
{
  [ref]: {
    type,
    error: [],
    meta?: {}
  },
  // ...
}
```

#### request failure - `API_RESP_FAIL`

If the `fetch` fails entirely, no responses will be delivered to the
application - `state.api` will not receive new data. Instead, an `API_RESP_FAIL`
action will be dispatched, which will populate `state.api.fail`.

**Redux state after being processed by `API_RESP_FAIL` action**

```js
{
  error: Error,
  // ...  all other data is stale but technically still valid
}
```

### Route query functions

One of the primary uses for queries is to load route-specific data from the
API. The application will automatically generate these queries by calling
particular 'query creator' functions that are assigned to application routes,
producing a fully-qualified 'query' object from the routing state input.

Route query creator functions have two requirements:

1. They are assigned as _props_ of React Router `route`s .The `query` prop can
be either a single query creator function or an array of functions
2. They are pure functions that take the Router's `location` and `params`
extracted from the URL), and deliver a query object for the associated route.

#### Example query function

```js
export const GROUP_REF = 'group';
function groupQuery({ location, params }) {
	const { urlname } = params;

	return {
		ref: GROUP_REF,
		type: 'group',
		endpoint: `/${urlname}`,
		params: {
			fields: ['event_sample']
		},
	};
}

// applied to a route:

const groupRoute = {
	path: '/:urlname',
	query: groupQuery,
	component: GroupContainer,
};
```

## React recipes

### GET (lazy loading)

On page load, the application will automatically collect any query objects
generated by the query functions you assign to your routes. However, if you need
to make another GET request, you can manually dispatch an API request using the
`get` action creator from
[`apiActionCreators`](../src/actions/apiActionCreators.js).

```js
// Example.jsx
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return bindActionCreators({ get: api.get }, dispatch);
}

class Example extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    const lazyQuery = {
      endpoint: `${this.props.match.params.urlname}/more/stuff`,
      ref: 'moreStuff',
      params: { foo: 'bar' },
    };
    this.props.get(lazyQuery);
  }
}
```

### POST

```js
// Example.jsx
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

const NEW_STUFF_REF = 'newStuff';

function mapStateToProps(state) {
  // when the POST returns, the response will be accessible in Redux state,
  // populated by an `API_RESP_SUCCESS` or `API_RESP_ERROR` action
  return {
    NEW_STUFF_REF: state.api[NEW_STUFF_REF],  
  };
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return bindActionCreators({ post: api.post }, dispatch);
}

class Example extends React.Component {
  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    if (nextProps[NEW_STUFF_REF]) {
      // the POST returned _something_ - maybe an error
      // you probably want to call `this.setState` or something here
    }
  }
  onSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();  // prevent full-page submit
    const postQuery = {
      endpoint: `${this.props.match.params.urlname}/new/stuff`,
      ref: NEW_STUFF_REF,
      params: this.state.formValues,  // this would be set by controlled inputs in the form
    };
    this.props.post(postQuery);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
        ...
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Uploading files

API POST/PATCH endpoints that support file uploads have one additional
constraint because the file data cannot be easily JSON-serialized like `params`
in other query objects.

The standard way of encoding form data that includes file uploads is to assemble
the entire form contents into a [`FormData`
instance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/FormData), which
allows the file contents to be passed around the application as a `Blob` that
can be encoded for transmission.

To form a Query with form data, simply pass a `FormData` instance as the
`params` property

```js
// Example.jsx
import * as api from 'meetup-web-platform/lib/actions/apiActionCreators';

const NEW_FILE_STUFF = 'newFileStuff';

function mapStateToProps(state) {
  // when the POST returns, the response will be accessible in Redux state,
  // populated by an `API_RESP_SUCCESS` or `API_RESP_ERROR` action
  return {
    NEW_FILE_STUFF: state.api[NEW_FILE_STUFF],  
  };
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return bindActionCreators({ post: api.post }, dispatch);
}

class Example extends React.Component {
  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    if (nextProps[NEW_FILE_STUFF]) {
      // the POST returned _something_ - maybe an error
      // you probably want to call `this.setState` or something here
    }
  }
  onSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();  // prevent full-page submit
    const postQuery = {
      endpoint: `${this.props.match.params.urlname}/new/stuff`,
      ref: NEW_FILE_STUFF,
      params: new FormData(this.form),  // one stop form encoding - forces 'multipart/form-data' content type
    };
    this.props.post(postQuery);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form
        onSubmit={this.onSubmit}
        ref={el => this.form = el}
      >
        ...
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

### PATCH

In practice, a PATCH request is just a POST by another name - use the `post`
action creator from `apiActionCreators`.

### DELETE

In practice, a DELETE request is just a GET by another name - use the `delete`
action creator from `apiActionCreators`.

The response will generally be a '204 - No Content',
so you'll have to read the 'updated' value in Redux state a little more
carefully.
