/**
 * Server-side utilities for managing signed duotone photo scaler URLs
 *
 * **Important** Do not import this module in client-side code
 *
* - All duo-toning is done in the photo scaler (http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photo_api/...)
 *   the duotoned images aren't saved anywhere
 * - The photo scaler requires signed URLs in order to ensure that requests are
 *   coming from "authorized" clients that aren't going to DDoS it.
 * - The URL signature corresponds to a particular photo scaler transform 'spec',
 *   including dimensions, which can then be applied to any photo. The REST API
 *   does not provide the duotoned URLs because they tend to be application-
 *   specific - it just returns a pair of hex values corresponding to the
 *   duotone 'light_color' and 'dark_color'.
 * - In order to sign the URL, the application needs a secret salt for the hash,
 *   which means the signing needs to happen on the server for a fixed set of
 *   transformations (one for each duotone color pair).
 * - Once the server has the signed URLs (which never change - they can be
 *   applied to any photo ID), it needs to send them to the client through
 *   application state, which is the only data link that currently exists
 *   between the server and the application.
 *
